# methods listed in this file, along with any helper methods you need.    #
# The public methods shown in this file are the ones you need for         #
# Milestone #1.  You will need to add other public methods for later      #
# milestones, as described in the handout.  For Milestone #7, you will    #
# need to move the getNextRoom method into the AdvGame class and replace  #
# it with a getPassages method that returns the dictionary of passages.   #
